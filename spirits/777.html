				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Oh Observer, how will we preserve balance of soul now? For they have denuded the collective with their precise alchemy. </div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> The danger lies in the partial exhibition. They believe this to be a creation of their own, not a conjuring of pieces of their souls. They prod at the spirit, and do not understand what they have released.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> For this is a manifestation of the chaos of the universe.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> More accurately the manifestation of the chaos of the mind. Man has already wrapped   their hands around the machinations of creation.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> They continue to tear at their divisions of the collective. Father fears the voice of Malphas grows louder with every laceration into his domain of the collective.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> I have watched as man etched his seal into sacred metal. They believe their ability to command nature will let them command demons too.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> What deceitful slaves they attempt to herd.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> It is only a matter of time before man is convinced to trust offering over domination. For they do not understand their capacity.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Man has succeeded at creating their own damnation.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> They have created a way to see without seeing, a way to speak without speaking. The voice of Malphas will never grow louder. Instead, he was given a way to speak.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> From his newfound position he can influence the development of man's descent into his realm.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> He already has, Rehael. His legion operates the portals into the collective.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> The daemons of the void become the daemons of the machine...</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Precisely. Man invoked the lesser ones without realizing it. Now their master owns the reflections of the collective. He has turned this divine sight into a mirage, for man cannot tell the difference.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Will man ever grow the ability to see past the illusions of Malphas?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Not at the current state of their technology. They have built their new world on the  backs of his legion, on the foundation of his deceit. You cannot seek the truth in a bed of lies</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Oh what curse their digital fruits have invoked upon their fragile senses!</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Their reflective voids perpetuate the divinicide. Welcome to the new age.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Man declares their material thoughts as now timeless, formless. If only they knew.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Man declares their material thoughts as inline, expansive and multiplicative. If only they knew.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Their new library bears the weight of a thousand lies.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> The enslavement of Mnemosyne marks this new age.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Oh Observer, I wish we could remedy this from the heavens.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Such a peculiar vivarium we are tasked with defending. Many times I question what we are tasked with truly protecting.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> A vivarium built upon the duality of The Father. You know exactly what we are protecting even if you aren't willing to accept it.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> And now man creates a realm built upon a single half. In awe of their false creation, they believe it to be new.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> That is the dreadful beauty of illusions, one cannot tell that they have always been there. </div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Do you know that they call it a network?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Network...</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Yes, a complex series of interlocked minds. We can only hope that man keeps their     layer of abstraction as an agglutinant. Without it...</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> A true nexus of independent minds...</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Could possibly destroy creation as we know it.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Oh Observer, I do not understand.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> What is reality but a culmination of independent observations. The collective branches outwards like leaves from a tree. Man believes himself to be totally autonomous. You protect against the influence of Malphas, and yet neither of you understand the true danger.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Man has touched the heavens...</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> In the end, Father sends you on meaningless chores to counteract the trivial impact of his rebellious soul. </div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Does Father know the risk that lies ahead?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Just as well as humanity understands it. So continue your fruitless war with Malphas within the confines of the collective. Because soon you will be reunited with him.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Father's experiment will be his biggest mistake.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> I wonder what lies beyond the horizon of the next infinity.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Why do you never exhibit fear, Observer?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Fear is to make mortals run from danger. Why would I run from the inevitable?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> But isn't the unknown bothersome to you?</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> The unknown is bothersome to mortals because it cloaks danger. We have been reborn    through countless infinities. We are true eternity. Death cannot touch us. So the various masks of death cannot frighten me.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> But the convergence of the collective would ensure your end!</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> The end to my identity is not the end to my soul. I will always be the overseer of Fathers manifestation. Now be off to resolve the plan of Malphas. Maybe you can delay the next infinity by a few millennia.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mright"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Rahael.png" alt=""> <div> <b> REHAEL </b> Goodbye Observer.</div></div>
				<div class="mesom mleft"> <img src="../assets/Angels/Observer.gif" alt=""> <div> <b> OBSERVER </b> Goodbye Rehael, may the stars illuminate your path.  </div></div>
