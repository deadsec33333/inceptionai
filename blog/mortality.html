		<h2>Preamble</h2>
		This is a reformat of a anthology I wrote in high school. The work follows an unorthodox structure that deserves some explanation. The introduction section describes a overarching philosophical question and
		my personal connections and thoughts regarding it. Note that the introduction was written prior to any proper research, and only is a surface-level discussion of my question. Next, the history will provide a brief summary of events and works that relate to my central question. The majority of the anthology is within the three artifacts, which are 
		each an in-depth analysis of works that provide significant insight into how my question has been addressed throughout history. And lastly, the conclusion speaks for itself.

		<hr>
		<p>
			&emsp;The main thing that differentiates us from animals is our
			ability to defy our instincts. Our free will means that we are able to decide our fate and the
			fate of others. That is an extremely daunting responsibility, and I believe that is why we cling
			to different moral codes. However, we are the same as animals in the fact that our time on
			earth is limited. This concept of the inevitability of death and its impact on our decisions has
			always intrigued me. And by analyzing these two concepts separately, I realized how much
			they interconnect. <br> <br>
			&emsp;Religion, in particular, has intrigued me with its strong link between death and
			morality. Many religions base their importance of moral actions on how they impact what
			happens to you in the afterlife, whether that is a concept of Heaven or Karma. I noticed that
			often in western culture, death is perceived as something to be dreaded. From this, I always
			wondered why the inevitability of our deaths made us focus so strongly on our present
			actions. For some, it’s a case of not ending off with any regrets, and for others, it’s a
			completely religious motivation. <br> <br>
			&emsp;A fun thought experiment I have been asked is something along the lines of "If you
			could live forever, what would you do?". While it's interesting to think about all the
			possibilities, one thing I always wondered about was how much the impact of my decisions
			would matter if I outlived them. In a grander sense, if I lived beyond the repercussions of my
			actions, would it matter if I made moral decisions? Something else that I considered is if
			everyone were immortal, couldn't they also outgrow the negative and positive impact I’ve
			had upon them? If we could never die, then why would we need pain, and if we never felt
			pain, then why would one need empathy? <br> <br>
			&emsp;Something else that sparked my interest in this subject was how when I talk to
			people much older than myself, they often reflect on the things they regret doing to others.
			Especially when I was little, my first thought was why wouldn’t they just go back and fix their
			mistake. However, hearing all these stories of things people wished they did, or ways they
			wished they acted helped me realize something. I thought to myself that perhaps the reason
			people put so much emphasis on morality is a hope to alleviate the regrets of our ancestors
			long after they have passed. It is impossible to make the right decision every second of
			one's life, and someone can’t fix all the impacts their actions had on the people around
			them, but perhaps by passing experiences and advice forward, one can hope that future
			people can live on with the lessons they learned long after they’re gone. <br> <br>
			&emsp;Morality and mortality are complicated, and together they feed unsolvable
			existential questions. The only thing that is certain in life is that one day it will end, and I
			hope to explore how this fact impacts the decisions we make during our time on Earth. Why
			do we place such importance on making moral actions while we are here? Would we still
			place importance on our actions if we were immortal?</p>

			<h2 class="centerme">History</h2>
			<hr>

			<i style="font-weight:normal !important">A brief summary of some occurrences that contributed to my “big question”.</i>
			<br>
			<strong>The punishment of Prometheus in Greek mythology</strong>
			In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus defied the gods and stole the
			ancient fire, giving it to humanity to advance civilization. His punishment for
			stealing fire was that he was bound with chains and an eagle would eat out
			his immortal liver every day. Prometheus and his actions are often idolized,
			especially during the Romantic period. From his story stems the concept of a
			Promethean Hero, one who defies authority and traditional moral laws. The
			Promethean Hero signifies an intuitive, independent practice of moral
			decision-making. Instead of relying on established rules, Prometheus made
			his decision based on his own virtues and ambitions. Additionally, his
			immortality serves as a way to exemplify the inescapable nature of the
			consequences of one’s actions. Although Immortality is often revered, this tale
			demonstrates Prometheus’ immortality being used against him. This concept
			reflects the idea that death could be seen as a gift; it provides emancipation
			from the consequences of our actions.

			<strong>Plato’s, Apology of Socrates (399 BCE)</strong>
			The Apology of Socrates records the speech of Socrates during his trial. Most
			significantly, Socrates addressed the jury at the end of his trial, famously
			demonstrating a lack of fear regarding his death. Socrates imagined two
			possible outcomes after his execution, an endless sleep or a transition to
			another place. He argued that endless sleep is nothing to be scared of,
			comparable to a normal dreamless rest. And alternatively, he argued that if
			his soul advanced to a new realm, that he could continue to learn and explore.
			Additionally, the last line of Plato's writing quotes Socrates’ departure with the
			saying, “The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways - I to die, and
			you to live. Which is better God only knows.”

			<strong>Book of Ecclesiastes (~450-200 BCE) </strong>
			A heavy influence of western culture, as promoted through Christianity, is the
			book of Ecclesiastes. Ecclesiastes is one of the books within the Christian Old
			Testament, and one of the Ketuvim within the Hebrew Tanakh. An overarching
			subject of Ecclesiastes is mortality and judgment. The writing often
			paradoxically discusses the Earthly impermanence of a single individual’s
			decisions, as well as the judgment of their actions by God. Its passages also
			signify that each decision matters and will be judged on the day of death.
			Death, and in tandem, divine judgment are used as a motivator to follow the
			moral doctrines of God.

			<strong>Martin Luther Posts the 95 Theses to the Church in Wittenberg (1517) </strong>
			A common aspect of the Christian faith is the belief in reaching salvation, or
			the forgiveness of sins. The importance of salvation lies in the fact that it
			signifies an afterlife in Heaven. The perception of death in the Catholic
			denomination is that of a looming destination, the time of judgment. They
			place the utmost importance on your current actions to avoid purgatory after
			death. However, prior to the Reformation, the Catholic church sold
			“indulgences”, which could absolve sins and guarantee salvation. Indulgences
			infuriated Martin Luther, who posted 95 theses opposing commoditable
			indulgences on the door of a church in Wittenberg. The actions of Martin
			Luther is one of the sparks of the Protestant Reformation, causing a huge
			paradigm shift towards the practice of independent atonement. This focus on
			the individual instead of a Catholic authority meant that people developed
			their own interpretations of the Bible, including different moral tenets to avoid
			purgatory.

			<strong>Maria Van Oosterwijck’s Vanitas Still Life (1668) </strong>
			Oosterwycks painting is one of many examples from the 1600s of the vanitas
			still life genre of painting. These paintings rely heavily on symbolism to depict
			a clear message on the ephemeral nature of life and the futility of
			self-gratification (similar to the book of Ecclesiastes). Oosterwycks painting
			specifically uses wine, flowers, and instruments that surround a skull to signify
			the impermanence of worldly pleasure and the importance of actions on the
			chances of redemption. This style of artwork exemplifies an early perspective
			on death and its inevitability, pushing a sense of worthlessness towards vanity
			and a focus on upholding the teachings of Christianity. While paintings such
			as Oosterwijck’s all had the same message regarding pursuits and the
			certainty of death, they also serve as a powerful call for self-reflection about
			one’s actions.

			<strong>Friedrich Nietzsche’s, The Gay Science (1882) and On the Genealogy of Morality (1887) </strong>
			The philosophy and dialogue of Nietzche can be viewed as extremely jarring,
			especially in the pretext of the time period of his works. Nietzsche attacked
			Christians, denoting their tenets as “slave morality”, formulating the idea that
			Christians made virtues out of their cowardice. Nietzsche proclaimed that the
			moral principles defined by Christianity, as well as the concept of divine
			judgment, is built on a fantasy of revenge towards their historical oppressors.
			From his contention with Christianity and divine purpose, Nietzsche is also well
			known for his nihilistic beliefs. He claimed the acceptance that life has no
			intrinsic purpose allowed us to overcome old values and dictate our morals
			based on our own beliefs and aspirations.

			<strong>The Electric Chair (~1890)</strong>
			The electric chair is a form of execution that stemmed from the late 1800s, as
			a response to the inhumane nature of botched hangings. The idea came from
			Alfred P. Southwick, after witnessing the near-instant death of a man who
			touched the terminals of a generator. The electric chair, as well as execution in
			general, are the source of heated ethical debates. Two moral issues arise in
			the debate of capital punishment, does the fear of death serve as a proper
			deterrent against crime, and is it ever ethical to take a life, even one of a
			murderer.

			<h3>Excerpt - Ecclesiastes 3</h3>
			<br> There is a time for everything,
<br> and a season for every activity under the heavens:
 
<br> a time to be born and a time to die,
<br> a time to plant and a time to uproot,
 
<br> a time to kill and a time to heal,
<br> a time to tear down and a time to build,

<br> a time to weep and a time to laugh,
<br> a time to mourn and a time to dance,

<br> a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them,
<br> a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,

<br> a time to search and a time to give up,
<br> a time to keep and a time to throw away,

<br> a time to tear and a time to mend,
<br> a time to be silent and a time to speak,
<br> 
<br> a time to love and a time to hate,
<br> a time for war and a time for peace.
<br> <br>
What do workers gain from their toil?  I have seen the burden God has laid on the human
race.  He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human
heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.  I know that there
is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.  That each of
them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God.  I know
that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken
from it. God does it so that people will fear him.

<br> 
<br> Whatever is has already been,
<br> and what will be has been before;
<br> and God will call the past to account.
<br> 
<br> And I saw something else under the sun:
<br> In the place of judgment—wickedness was there,
<br> in the place of justice—wickedness was there.
<br> 
<br> I said to myself,
<br> “God will bring into judgment
<br> both the righteous and the wicked,
<br> for there will be a time for every activity,
<br> a time to judge every deed.”
<br> <br>
 I also said to myself, “As for humans, God tests them so that they may see that they are
 like the animals.  Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate
 awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no
 advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless.  All go to the same place; all come
 from dust, and to dust all return.  Who knows if the human spirit rises upward and if the
 spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?”
 
 So I saw that there is nothing better for a person than to enjoy their work, because that is
 their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?


 <hr>


&emsp; The ethical principles we adopt are heavily influenced by our culture and
experiences. And one massive cultural landmark, and such, an influencer of moral codes
throughout history is the Bible. Many people look toward their interpretations of the Bible to
make tough moral decisions. However, Ecclesiastes is unique in its humanistic approach to
morality by contextualizing it with death. Ecclesiastes has a strong focus on the ephemeral
nature of human life and seeks to justify how we should spend our limited time on Earth.
Ecclesiastes 3 in particular is interesting to fixate on due to it’s heavy focus on the actions
within our lifetime, as well as its introduction to divine judgment.
<br><br>
&emsp; This chapter of Ecclesiastes starts off by describing contrasts within the human
condition through the use of the repeating phrase “a time to…”. Each line introduces two
opposite ideas, emphasizing that within each dichotomy, there is a “time” for each side. The
first iteration of the ”time to” pattern is “a time to be born and a time to die”, immediately
hammering in the certainty of death. Prefacing the entirety of the passage with death
establishes that each experience and action is a fragment within the short period of
existence, birth and death mark the “boundaries of life under the sun” (qtd. In Guzik). This
demarcation is also restated near the end, “all come from dust, and to dust all return”,
alluding to the creation story in Genesis. The use of the remaining “a time to” lines also
signifies the commonality and repetitive nature of human action. Our lives have a cycle of
choices in a continuous pattern throughout our existence and the same cycles will
perpetuate in the lives of all people following. From this, nothing truly “new” can emerge,
undermining grand achievement in favor of present action. (Harris). These remaining lines
also show how limited we are in the amount of decisions we are able to make before death.
<br><br>
&emsp; Another notable quote from this chapter is “everything God does will endure forever”.
It is safe to assume that this line is referring to the eternal aspect of nature. When compared
to the longevity of nature, human pursuits are temporal and insignificant. The aspect of
nature as being infinite in comparison to the short-lived influence by the individual further
emphasizes that after death, our influence is lost and our achievements lose most of their
meaning. Overall providing a message that our impact is just as vulnerable to decay as our
own bodies.
<br><br>
&emsp; The most frightening aspect of death alongside its inevitability is its uncertainty, “the
circumstances in which we will die are not predictable. Death’s time, place and
circumstances—as a result of old age, accident or illness—are beyond reach of human
knowledge” (Baeke). We will never know when, or how we will die, making the importance of
our actions all the greater. We do not know how many more “times” or decisions we have
left, therefore we cannot take any moment for granted.
<br><br>
&emsp; The passage attempts to alleviate the unpleasant reminder of death by emphasizing
the current moment and doing “good” with the time you have. This is described in the claim
that the best way for someone to live is to “be happy and to do good while they live”.
Ecclesiastes 3 does not attempt to define what “good” is, but aims to remind you that time is
limited. It encourages you to do “good” (whatever that may be) while you still can. Overall,
Ecclesiastes, much like the rest of Christianity “does not provide a clear and detailed road
map to a just society, but it does invite and encourage us to undertake the journey”
(Fitzgerald). While this passage provides a harsh reminder of how insignificant and short an
individual’s life is, it establishes that this meaninglessness is not an excuse to be immoral.
Rather, it implores people to do what's best for their own and others' happiness.
<br><br>
&emsp; With this rather grim view towards human existence, the message of this passage
could be misinterpreted as encouraging acting out of self-interest. However, through the
introduction of “judgment”, a reason and drive is provided to follow the moral guidelines
defined within the Bible. The passage proclaims that “God will bring into judgment both the
righteous and wicked”. This statement is then followed by “there will be a time for every
activity, a time to judge every deed”, directly linking with the opening lines, emphasizing that
each decision has ethical significance. This repetition reinforces that everything you do will
be held against moral standards that transcend human law.
<br><br>
&emsp; The concept of judgment is also stated in clearer terms at the end of Ecclesiastes 12,
which asserts that “God will bring every deed into judgment, along with every hidden thing,
whether good or evil”. This ending sentence not only uses the dichotomy of “good” and
“evil”, but also contextualizes their definition of “good” and “evil” as relating to the Ten
Commandments by preceding this line with “keep His [God’s] commandments''. Divine
judgment is used to unify the inevitability of death with the importance of morality. It
forewarns that each decision within your life-span will be judged according to a moral code
and each of these decisions is part of the march towards the inescapable destination of
death.
<br><br>
&emsp; Additionally, one possible interpretation of divine judgement within Ecclesiates is of
“particular judgment”, being a post-mortem personal judgement by God. If particular
judgement was the intended meaning of “judgment” within Ecclesiastes, death serves an
even more significant role because it is the deadline of when all your actions will be weighed
on a celestial moral scale. An outlook towards post-mortem judgment also aims to “rectify
pre-mortem injustices” (Takeuchi) creating incentive to be moral during one's time on earth,
in avoidance of punishment during the afterlife.
The fear of judgment only holds its impact over those who believe in it. However, the
inevitability of death is universal, and the call to do good with the time you have is just as
powerful without a divine moral judge. Ecclesiastes is so powerful because it can be viewed
solely for it’s highlighting of death, as well is it’s idea of judgement.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Artifact 2 - <i>Andy Warhol: Little Electric Chair(s)</i></h2>
			<hr>
			<img src="../assets/p13.png" class="largimg fll" alt="">		
			<hr>
&emsp;One artist that had a unique obsession with mortality is Andy Warhol. Warhol
explored the public perception of death; specifically how tragedy is propagated throughout
the masses by the media in his “death and disasters” series of silkscreen paintings. All of his
works share a similar message about the public perception of death. However, his Little
Electric Chairs series is extremely interesting, unlike his other pieces, the electric chair does
not depict a gruesome event that has already happened, but a prospective tool for killing. <br><br>
&emsp;Little Electric Chair depicts a chair dubbed ‘Old Sparky’ at the Sing Sing penitentiary
in New York (Halperin). While the dark and grainy texture creates a foreboding mood, the
actual content of the image is fairly unassuming; an empty chair in a room. However, when
the piece is contextualized with its name and history, the terror and intent of the paintings is
revealed. The fact that the subject is not an imaginary or ancient device, but a real, modern
instrument for killing, invokes a harsh realization and a sense of panic. The reality that
people have died in this chair gives the piece its weight. The electric chair started as a more
humane method of execution, but it has become an infamous symbol of the controversy
surrounding capital punishment, especially during Warhol’s time. <br><br>
&emsp;The electric chair, like other forms of capital punishment, is a symbol of Hobbes’s
leviathan (Lee). A main rationale for capital punishment is deterrence, exploiting
self-preservation to prevent crime. Regardless of the argued effectiveness of capital
punishment as a deterrent, the tools used for execution serve as a clear icon of death and
our fear of it. Warhol's painting embraces this emblematic representation of fear extremely
well. The high contrast emphasizes the chair, similar to a spotlight. There is no natural light,
people, or objects other than the chair, creating a sinister and foreboding scene. The prints
understand that the power of the electric chair doesn’t come from its lethality, but its idle
stages. The chair is not actively doing anything, and its yielding stance creates more anxiety
than a depiction of it in action. The terror comes from the fact that the chair will remain
inactive, unchanged, and waiting. This machine acts as a constant looming reminder to stay
in line with moral guidelines defined within the law. The intended target of this fear is not the
convicted criminal, but the general public. The electric chair and press reports of its use aim
to be a warning memento for the public eye. <br><br>
&emsp;In an interview with Gene Swenson, Warhol is quoted describing how “when you see
a gruesome picture over and over again, it doesn’t really have any effect.” (Swenson). While
Little Electric Chair captures a sense of fear extremely well, Warhol acknowledges that the
strong reaction to death invoked by his prints is quickly diminished with repetition. Not only
did Warhol often paint his prints in a series, but his source material comes from press
photos that have been copied thousands of times. A single, isolated view of this painting is
horrifying, but the repetition quickly desensitizes us. Warhol mimics the repetitive onslaught
of dreadful images by the press. He uses this repetition to convey how the ceaseless
depictions of death in the media quickly takes away from what would ordinarily be a
visceral reaction to such imagery. Warhol expresses how death's constant coverage in the
news, even today, “distances us from the intensity and seriousness of the topic.” (Morgan). It
is easy to quickly become numb to these paintings, and this was most likely Warhols intent.
His paintings convey how constant, universal coverage destroys the intense reaction
towards death within the public, undermining the effectiveness of viewing death as a
cautionary lesson.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Artifact 3 - <i>Damien Hirst: For The Love Of God</i></h2>
			<hr>
			<img src="../assets/89.png" class="largimg fll" alt="">		
			<hr>
			&emsp; Perhaps one of the most eye-grabbing and disturbing combinations possible, Hirsts
For The Love Of God is a platinum cast of a human skull covered in diamonds. The piece
has a heavy sense of irony between its presentation and theme. By exploiting and
manipulating common themes of death and luxury, this sculpture explores the connection
between our mortality and how we justify our worth in life. <br><br>
&emsp; For The Love of God utilizes two of the most universal symbols for mortality and
vanity. The skull is arguably one of the most recognizable symbols of our mortality, and
diamonds act as a symbol of wealth and material beauty. Hirst uses this combination of
mediums to relate the inevitability of death with the living’s obsession with wealth. The use
of diamonds and platinum, in particular, holds significance because these materials are
near-indestructible and forever-lasting. These materials are used to convey “the idea that
the indestructible luxury of the object [represents] a victory over decay and death” (Fuchs).
With our flesh decays our image, all that remains is a featureless impression of us, as
represented by the skull. Long after our bodies and the memory of us have rotted away, the
diamonds and platinum remain in a cast of our archetype, no definable features, such as
the face remain. This piece suggests that all that can be associated with us after our death
is our perceived value. With this grim view of our legacy after death, we are incentivized to
ask what do our actions matter beyond the legacy we decorate ourselves with after we die. <br><br>
&emsp; For the Love of God is intended to act as a memento mori, being a symbol for the
inevitability of death (For The Love of God). However, this piece’s intent is different from
other forms of art associated with memento mori. More specifically, another art genre
associated with this concept is vanitas, which focuses on the vanity and futility of pleasure
and material achievement (Britannica). Similar to vanitas, this piece immediately grasps
your attention with the contrast of attainment and mortality, both symbols are intertwined
and are immediately apparent. However, Hirst’s message regarding death and our current
actions is completely different from many vanitases. Historically, vanitas is usually
influenced by Christianity and used their tone of impending death to promote following the
moral doctrines of Christianity and condemn the pursuit of material wealth and pleasure.
Hirst's sculpture, however, conveys a sense of glory in acquisition during life; “compared to
the tearful sadness of a vanitas scene, the diamond skull is glory itself. Covered by
diamonds as by mail, it became an object of eternal life in death” (Fuchs). His work still
contains the somber tone of death through the use of a skull but defies this inevitably by
embracing complete indulgence and decadence. <br><br>
&emsp; Hirst challenges another common intent in many vanitases, which is “to
focus believers’ attention on the afterlife” (Biles) from a spiritual standpoint. The art piece is
only focused on the earthly remains, rather than the soul. This rejection from the spiritual
aspect of vanitas is not only reflected in the sculptures presentation, but also directly from
the artist; “God’s f*****d off” (qtd. In Series). This quote from Hirst has a striking resemblance
to Nietzsche’s “God is dead”. Hirst shares a similar attitude towards God and religion as
Nietzche, and from this perspective, Hirst disconnects his work from any divine motivation.
In contradiction to vanitas, his work conveys one of “Nietzche’s well-known critique[s];
investment in an afterlife effectively devalues the present, earthly life”. The piece
acknowledges the fleetingness of life, but with its disconnect from any religious idea of the
afterlife, Hirst proclaims that the decadence displayed on his piece is “the only thing of real
value in a brief life” (Biles).

&emsp;Death is a commonality that transcends all culture, language, and history. In fact,
death's universality is beyond us, even stars die. But the implications assigned to death are
intrinsically human. Additionally, the attempt to define and enforce morality is solely a
humanitarian endeavor. It is easy to observe how universal the human focus on death and
morality is across cultures and history. However, the extent to which these ideas are
interconnected within philosophy, religion, and law is much greater than I had originally
anticipated. Our fascination with death has been ingrained in all cultures for the entirety of
human history, but it’s correlation to morality has existed for as long as man has been able
to communicate. <br><br>
&emsp;The inevitability of death has been applied to a variety of philosophies. One trend I
observed is our certain demise being used to devoid things of meaning. This invalidation of
meaning occurs from the fact that “(a) death undermines the predictability and
controllability of one’s existence, (b) death eliminates all potential that one has for earning
meaning in the future, (c) death reminds people that their existence and the meaning
framework that they have constructed will likely be forgotten, and (d) death nullifies the
value of one’s life’s achievements.‖” (qtd. in Pyszczynski). However, what is being defined as
meaningless through the inevitability of death varies significantly. One end of this view
emphasizes the futility of material achievement, you cannot take your wealth with you.
Utilizing death to argue against materialism has mainly been used to emphasize the
importance of actions over possessions, usually in a moral context. In an opposing view, a
similar sense of purposelessness is applied to behavior. The idea of vanity is directly
contradicted by the idea that within the futility of life, the only thing of significance is
material gain and pleasure while alive; proposing that morality doesn’t matter because we
are going to die anyway. Both viewpoints exploit the ephemeral nature of life in justification
for a moral ideology, despite being philosophically contrary to each other. <br><br>
&emsp;Additionally, another trend is death being used to add urgency and incentive
towards action. “Human systems of meaning, morality, and religion took on death-denying
functions that added urgency to them and changed the end states toward which they
directed behavior” (Pyszczynski). The sense of urgency formed by death has been utilized
by both religion and law. Death has been used as the demarcation for the afterlife,
providing moral incentive while on Earth for the promise of divine reward. And the fear of
death has been exploited by the law to incentivize following established moral principles. <br><br>
&emsp;As we push further into the modern age, we may be able to address the causes of
death with advancements in technology; but our mortality remains inevitable. The fight
against death is the ultimate futility, the same futility that has loomed over us forever. As we
continue to learn about our biology and our weaknesses, we formulate ways to delay our
eventual demise. Because of public health improvements, “Over the last 200 years, U.S. life
expectancy has more than doubled to almost 80 years” (Ninde). While we may be able to
prolong our lives, immortality is currently outside of our reach. Because of this, our mortality
will always remain in the pretext of our minds and culture. Similarly, the struggle to define
what’s moral is just as persistent and universal as death. The attempt to empiricize morality
is impossible. There will always be constant debate and interpretations over what is moral.
Every individual applies their own unique abstract moral principles to their lives; influenced
by their experiences as well as their cultural, religious, and political identities (Ellemers). As
long as humans are unique, our set of moral ideals will be equally unique. However, death
serves as a commonality above all culture and law. Because of this, the relationship
between mortality and morality will hold significance as long as humans exist. Both
concepts are fundamental to our psychology and humanity. No matter what direction we
take in the future, we will invariably seek to define what's moral and we will always have
death as a commonality to justify our moral paradigms. <br><br>
&emsp;Death will always influence our lives, it’s part of being human. Our mortality will
continue to serve as a focal point for a majority of existential questions, questions that
cannot be answered with science and technology. What the future holds is unforeseeable,
but one thing is guaranteed; we will die. Regardless of if you decorate your time on earth
with diamonds or “good” intentions, the consequences of your actions will eventually fade
away. I have also realized that my big question has an ironic tone. Death is a fundamental,
concrete truth and morality is an abstract concept. However, we have consistently used one
of the most certain aspects of our lives as a way to justify one of the most subjective
demonstrations of our humanity.
