			Github is <a href="https://github.com/antecomp/dotfiles">here</a>, however I do a really poor job updating it.
			<br>
			Note that this is not a guide, but just a gallery and description of my setup/rice. Although, I am open to any questions/comments on my <a href="https://omnipresence.neocities.org/">discord server.</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			2023 Update - I no longer use mint! I got a new desktop and laptop and decided to go with Arch on both of them. My theme remains mostly the same but I added some new stuff :)
			<strong>
				Basic details of my setup
			</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Distro: Arch (formerly Mint)</li>
				<li>WM: i3</li>
				<li>Compositor: <a href="https://github.com/jonaburg/picom">Jonaburg Picom</a></li>
				<li>Fonts used: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa">Comfortaa</a> and <a href="https://www.dafont.com/kiona-2.font">Kiona</a></li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Colourscheme (loosely)</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Overall: Dark blue with teal and white highlights</li>
				<li>Background Colours: #010407 #030b0e #03090e #020b11</li>
				<li>Buttons: #06121d #081723</li>
				<li>Highlight/Selected:  #11aeb0 #034953 #105f6a</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Wallpapers</strong>
			Most of my wallpapers come from <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/3434849">Gracile</a>, who makes amazing art
			that goes extremely well with my colourscheme.

			<h1>Screenshots</h1>
			<br>
			<h2>Desktop</h2>
			Here is a preview of the whole rice :)
			<img src="../rice/desktop.png" class="largimg" alt="" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>GTK3</h2>
			My GTK theme was generated using <a href="https://github.com/themix-project/oomox">oomox</a>. My GTK theme was
			the basis for how I would style the rest of my system. I chose something dark and low in contrast for a theme
			that was very easy on the eyes while still looking pretty. 
			<br> Certain programs such as nemo have an opacity rule set on them using picom, giving most of my theme a glassy-blurred
			look against the wallpaper.
			<br>
			The icon theme is <a href="https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1332404">Flatery Teal</a>
			<img src="../rice/gtk.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Terminal</h2>
			The terminal emulator I use is <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>. I absolutely love kitty from a ricing
			and productivity standpoint; the built in keyboard-oriented tabs and tiling is a godsend.
			<br>
			I am using <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a> as my main shell. What it lacks in POSIX-compliancy, it makes up for in raw features. 
			Since every aspect of fish is divided into functions, it makes it extremely easy to modify the parts I want without editing a giant config file.

			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Conky + EWW</h2>
			My desktop uses conky for a clock and system info<br>
			I also have a panel system made with eww widgets.

			<br>
			<br>
			
			<h2>Web Browser</h2>
			I use vivaldi as my main web browser. The level of customization vivaldi offers is insane, allowing for a extremely beautiful and productive UI. The main aspect of vivaldi that I have fallen in love with is the vertical tabs.
			Not only do vertical tabs save a ton of screen-space, but they work well with my setup. Since my bar/panel are on the top of my screen, having the tabs on the side saves me from wasting a lot of vertical space and prevents misclicks.

			<h2>Spotify</h2>
			My spotify client is customized using spicetify. I use a recoloured version of the <a href="https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Ziro">Ziro</a> theme.
		    <img src="../assets/spotify.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Discord</h2>
			My discord is customized using <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/">BetterDiscord</a>. Please note that this is <i>techically</i> against the TOS (however it is hardly enforced). The theme I use is a recolour of <a href="https://betterdiscord.app/theme/Zelk">Zelk.</a>
		    <img src="../rice/discord.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Text Editor - Vim</h2>
			I use vim as my basic text editor (I cheat and use VSC for anything complex). I use <a href="https://github.com/embark-theme/vim">Embark</a> as the theme for my airline.
		    <img src="../assets/vim.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>PDF Reader - Zathura</h2>
			Zathura uses the same colorscheme as my terminal.
		    <img src="../assets/zathura.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Program Launcher - Rofi</h2>
			My rofi theme was based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/qqakia/oc_few_rofi_themes_pt_3_the_end/">this post.</a> However I have no idea where their github/reddit account went.
		    <img src="../assets/rofi.png" alt="" class="largimg" onclick="window.open(this.src)">

			<h2>Panel</h2>
			I use xfce4-panel, which works really well with i3.
