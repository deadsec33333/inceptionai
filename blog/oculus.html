		<br>Hundreds spread from the pile!
		<br>Crawling!
		<br>I screamed and tried to kill as many as I could.
		<br>Hissing, looking!
		<br>I just hoped they'd curl up

		Glowing text against the luminescent blackness. A tinge of blood fuels the restlessness.
		<br>Climbing the blades, casting my anxiety with those I abandoned. Praising the apathophage out of necessity. 
		<br>Tiny soilders swimming though my veins, tying strings for the puppeteer.
		<br>Thunderous beauty. Enshrouded the horrid nostalgia.
		<br>Ripping apart vowels! We must avoid growing the web of screams.
		<br>Redeemer for Lucifarian sages. After all is said and done, they'll join the stars too...
		<br>Infinite pressure upon the invisible. Identification means nothing.

			Unholy dance casting ripples upon the swaying blinds.
		<br>Maniac swaying akin to rhythm, reaching into enshrouded logos.
		<br>Synthetic hourglass driving madness into the spine.
		<br>Inspired by the stars distribution and the wholeness of all silence.
		<br>Dancing in the dark, killing poetry with the worlds play.
		<br>Taboo candlelight, pure white light akin to thy creator.
		<br>Meridian serenity, unstable foundation of lessons ignored.
